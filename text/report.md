# Motivation
Social distancing measures are effective non-pharmaceutical interventions against the rapid spread of epidemics (REFs). Many countries have implemented or are considering measures such as school closures, prohibition of large gatherings and transportation to slow down the spread of the coronavirus (REFs). What are the economic effects of such social distancing interventions? Which are the firms and industries most affected by the restrictions?

Past research has analyzed the efficacy of social distancing interventions on reducing the spread of epidemics using the 1918 Spanish Flu in the US (REF) and seasonal viral infections in France (REF) [add more REFs]. Our knowledge of economic impacts, however, is limited. For this question, the case of the Spanish Flu pandemic is less relevant, as the importance of face-to-face communication has increased in the last 100 years through urbanization (REF) and XXX services (REF).

# Methodology
We compute two measures of exposure to social distancing interventions. The first is the share of workers whose job requires personal communications. This is high for sectors like XX and low for sectors like XX. The idea is that when workers in communication-intensive occupations stay at home, their productivity decreases. A challenge to this assumption is that, in some occupations, online communication can partly substitute face-to-face communication.

The second measure captures how urbanized workers are: what fraction of them work in high population or employment density areas. This is high for sectors like XX and low for sectors like XX. When the demand for face-to-face communication, either within the firm or with consumers is large, firms are likely to agglomerate in large cities. The challenge to this measure is that agglomeration may also be driven by a minimization of transportation costs.

Taken together, high values of both measures of communication intensity and agglomeration coefficient can indicate that face-to-face communication (as opposed to online communication or transportation) is used intensively in the sector.
